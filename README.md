Strick-Rails
==========
A basic implementation of Ruby on Rails routing and controller functionality.

This project is a student project during my time at App Academy to dive into a deeper understand of Ruby on Rails.

In the project, I setup a webrick server and used Ruby meta-programming to build out the functionality for router handling and for ruby controllers.
